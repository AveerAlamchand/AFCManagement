# AFCManagement
A project for my Database systems module. We were tasked to build a Java Database application for a hypothetical business scenario. I decided to develop a football club manager in which you can manage an entire footballing world. It uses MySQL. I have added all the documentation for my MySQL tables and the sql commands used to generate data.
